A tree diagram is a diagram used in strategic decision making, valuation or probability calculations. 
The diagram starts at a single node, with branches emanating to additional nodes, which represent mutually 
exclusive decisions or events. In the diagram below, the analysis will begin at the first blank node. 
A decision or event will then lead to node A or B. From these secondary nodes, additional
decisions or events will occur leading to the third level of nodes until a conclusion is reached.

MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.
Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to
update controller if its data changes.
View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.
Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model 
object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.

NOTE- This is only half part of the project i.e forntend part. The other half of the project is API 
and its link is given below
